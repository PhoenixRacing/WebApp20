### Get auth.js

For security reasons, we do not publish `auth.js` on GitHub. You will have to get the `auth.js` file from a team lead or teammate. You can ask Sawyer or Radmer for a copy of the file.

### Recommended step: Install `nodemon`

`nodemon` automatically restarts the project when it notices any changes to files. This is very convenient. If you don't use nodemon, you'll have to manually restart the project each time you want to

1. Run `npm install -g nodemon` in Terminal, Git Bash, or Command Prompt. (You may need to add a `sudo` in front if using Ubuntu).

## First time setup

1. Run the project as detailed under `Run the project`.
2. Go to `localhost:3000/signup` in the browser, and sign up.
3. Go to the `WebApp20` folder in a shell.
4. Run `mongo`. You should enter a mongo shell.
5. Run `use olinbaja`.
6. Run `db.users.update({}, {"$set":{"admin":true}})`.

## Run the project

1. Open a shell and run `mongod`.
2. Open another shell and `cd` into the 'WebApp20' directory.
3. Run `nodemon app.js`. (Use `node` instead of `nodemon` if you didn't install `nodemon`). (NOTE: On Windows, you may need to do `nodemon ~/path/to/app.js` if it gives you an error).
4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser.
